# ASCII Art Animation in Python

This repository hosts a Python adaptation of an ASCII art animation, originally demonstrated in C by Lex Fridman in his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEqXNfs_HhY). The code generates dynamic ASCII art in the console, showcasing creative programming. The Python script aligns with the original logic, with adjustments for Python's syntax and libraries. Run the script in Python after cloning this repository for an interesting visual display.
